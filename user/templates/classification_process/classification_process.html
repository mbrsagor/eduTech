                        assessments that
                        truly measure student learning. Our innovative web-based application harnesses the power of
                        advanced machine learning algorithms to automatically classify exam questions according to
                        Bloom's Taxonomy. This ensures that your assessments are not
                        only accurate but also aligned with educational standards and learning objectives.</p>
